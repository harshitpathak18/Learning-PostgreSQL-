   SQL Joins 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
   This document provides an overview of SQL joins, which allow combining data
   from multiple tables to retrieve meaningful insights.

   Table of Contents:
   
     1. Basic Joins
        - INNER JOIN
        - LEFT JOIN
        - RIGHT JOIN
        - FULL JOIN
		
     2. Advanced Joins
        - LEFT ANTI JOIN
        - RIGHT ANTI JOIN
        - ALTERNATIVE INNER JOIN
        - FULL ANTI JOIN
        - CROSS JOIN
